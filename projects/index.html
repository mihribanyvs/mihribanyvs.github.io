        <h3><a href="prot_former.html">ProtSpark</a></h3>
        <p>
        Designed a pipeline to analyze protein sequences coming from Protein Data Bank (PDB) using PySpark. 
        Checked the cosine similarities between the sequences using embeddings from a pertained model (ProtBert). 
        The dataset was about 10 GB. We used 3 Virtual Machines with CPU’s, which ran the whole program in about 20 minutes. 
        For benchmarking we varied the number of cores, the size of the memory used and the number of workers.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="ising.html">Ising model on GPU</a></h3>
        <p>
        Simulated the Ising model using a Jetson Nano. Implemented two different ways to do the parallelization on the device 
        and benchmarked the results.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="transformer.html">Transformer From Scratch for Protein Data</a></h3>
        <p>
        Designed a transformer to predict the folding structure of proteins using the sequence information embedded using 
        the pertained ProtBert model. The model designed was aimed to understand the mechanics behind AlphaFold. 
        Using a custom loss function we achieved not so high accuracies but we were able to reproduce most of the tertiary 
        structures in addition to secondary structures.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="ultrametricPatterns.html">Ultrametric Patterns</a></h3>
        <p>
        Created ultra metric patterns and showed the storage capacity in a hop field network using these patterns.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="earthquakeAnalysis.html">Türkiye Earthquake Data Analysis</a></h3>
        <p>
        Worked on the earthquake measurement in Türkiye in the last 100 years. 
        Implemented the Gutenberg-Richter Law to predict the future earthquakes. 
        Analyzed the data as a time-series data. The results showed that the dataset is not a time-series and cannot be predicted as such.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="information.html">Information Bottleneck Theory in Deep Neural Networks</a></h3>
        <p>
        Created multiple networks for different datasets and trained them with changing the network parameters 
        (activation functions, optimizers, loss functions). Estimate the mutual information between the input and the layers, 
        between the layers and the labels to observe the learning in the information plane.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="colorization.html">Black&White Image colorization</a></h3>
        <p>
        Trained 2 CNN architectures on CIFAR dataset and try to predict the colorization of the images.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="purchaseTracker.html">Purchase Tracker</a></h3>
        <p>
        A small mobile app to keep track of my daily purchases.
